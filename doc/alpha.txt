assembly_peek.nvim is a plugin that I am designing to allow you to peek into assembly language versions of 
your code during development. I would like this to be useful for learning, specifically when testing out
if your code is using clever assembly logic.

  :h AlphaHelloWorld

AlphaHelloWorld                                                *AlphaHelloWorld*
    Just say "Hello world!!"

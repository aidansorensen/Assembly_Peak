assembly_peek.nvim is a plugin that I am designing to allow you to peek into assembly language versions of 
your code during development. I would like this to be useful for learning, specifically when testing out
if your code is using clever assembly logic.

to call floating window that displays functions that can be printed:
:lua require("assemblypeek.ui").toggle_quick_menu()
